  Employee Information and Time Log System 

## Project Description
Some workplaces still use paper to keep track of employee’s contact information and timesheets. Physical paper documents can be destroyed and misplaced leading to information and data being lost. This system was developed to help these businesses transition from paper to digital and provide a more current data collection and storage method. Employees can sign in and record their time for the week. The system also allows for the employer to view a collective list of employee contact information. In addition, the employer can also view a list of the submitted timesheets.  

## Instructions
The first page you will see is the login page. If you are new click the “create a user” link to document your contact information and login. If you are already in the system you will log in with your username and password. If you are logging in as an employee you are sent to a form to record your time. If you are the employer logging in you will use the specific employer username to access your viewing options. 

### New User Form 
The new user form is where new employees can insert their contact and login information. Fill all fields out with accurate and up-to-date information. Upon clicking the submission button, your information is documented in a table and you are sent back to the login page.
### Log Time Form 
The log time form is where employees can record the time they worked throughout the five-day workweek. Fill in the Id fields and the hours you worked on each respective day. Upon clicking the submission button the logged time is documented in a table and you are sent back to the login page.
### Employer Options
After the employer logs in, they are prompted to choose what they would like to see. Clicking the “Employees Contact Information” button will take you to a page displaying a list of all employees and their contact information. Clicking the “Employees Time Sheets” button will take you to a page displaying a list of all recorded timesheets.
